## Pet Adoption App

Friends of Animals, an animal shelter and adoption service provider needs to build a simple app for people to start adoption process.  

### Requirements

1. Visitors are shown pictures of animals one at a time, Tinder style, with simple text description.  They can then either choose to Like - starting the process, or Pass - viewing next one.  The gesture to choose only needs to be simple and intuitive - the use of swipe-left or right to choose is totally optional.  
2. Visitors can also click the picture to learn more about the animal.
3. Any animal chosen will create an Intention record in Salesforce, which can be used to start a meet-n-greet appointment to start the adoption process
4. (Bonus) Make the app available as public web page, so anyone can start viewing animals available for adoption by providing an email address
